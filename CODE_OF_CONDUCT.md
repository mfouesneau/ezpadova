We adopt a code of conduct that ensures a productive, respectful environment for all open source contributors and participants. We are committed to providing a strong and enforced code of conduct and expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others in all forums. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, thriving, and growing community. The community of participants in open source Astronomy projects such as this present work includes members from around the globe with diverse skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth.

We expect all contributors to adhere to the following principles:

We treat each other with respect and do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, disability, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation or identity. We believe that science is a diverse endeavor: diversity provides new impulses, new ideas, new perspectives, and innovation.

We conduct our research and support the research of others with integrity and according to the highest scientific standards. We are committed to scientific integrity and abiding by the guidelines of good scientific practice. We value scientific quality over quantity.

We discuss problems and implement solutions openly and respectfully; we communicate the principles and processes that underlie our actions and decisions.

We recognize the achievements of others, give credit where it is due, and offer constructive feedback when necessary. Science and innovation depend on an open and constructive discourse in which new ideas can be freely exchanged and old wisdom challenged.

We support each other in achieving our goals by nurturing trust and cooperation and respecting individual capabilities and needs. We know that research is often highly competitive, and people can feel under pressure to produce results. Because of these circumstances, we are committed to being mindful of personal boundaries and contributing to a nurturing work environment based on trust and mutual respect.

Any violations of this Code of Conduct should be reported to any of the core authors of this project.
